# claude-mods

Personal [Claude Code mods](https://code.claude.com/docs): plugins of function hooks that draw panes, bands and footers inside Claude Code. This repo is also a plugin marketplace, so every computer installs the same mods the same way.

| Mod | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`ctx`](./ctx) | Context window details in a pane and a band above the prompt: how full, how fast it is filling, what filled it, compacting on your terms, what each of those costs, and how fast the plan's limits are being spent. How to use it, and how to get the pane on the right: [ctx/README.md](./ctx/README.md). Why each feature exists: [ctx/DESIGN.md](./ctx/DESIGN.md). |
| [`subagent-progress`](./subagent-progress) | A progress bar above the prompt and a live agents panel for any subagent work, each subagent a crab whose costume follows its model and effort, closing into a green Done row. Fork of johnnyvizz's savvy-progress (renamed in 2.0.0); what changed: [subagent-progress/README.md](./subagent-progress/README.md). |
| [`prompt-upgrade`](./prompt-upgrade) | `/better` turns a rough prompt into a great one before it is sent: a pane asks up to three quick questions, rewrites the prompt and shows original and upgrade side by side, and nothing runs until you press Run. Optional automatic mode. Idea and spec from [tristenobrien.ai](https://tristenobrien.ai/); how to use it: [prompt-upgrade/README.md](./prompt-upgrade/README.md). |
| [`work-report`](./work-report) | `/work-report` shows what Claude has done for you: tasks finished, an estimate of the hours that saved you and what that time is worth, in a pane with Today, Week, Month and Year tabs. Counts only, kept in the mod's own store; no model calls. How to use it: [work-report/README.md](./work-report/README.md). |
| [`agent-pulse`](./agent-pulse) | A box above the prompt that says what Claude is doing right now, in plain English, alive with color and motion: a spinner per phase, a border that flashes when a call ends and breathes while Claude waits on you, a timeline of the turn, and a jellyfish on the desktop. Fork of Tzafrir Rehan's whats-agent-doing; what changed: [agent-pulse/README.md](./agent-pulse/README.md). Why: [agent-pulse/DESIGN.md](./agent-pulse/DESIGN.md). |
| [`arsenal`](./arsenal) | A menu for the tool mods: a `◆ Arsenal ▾` button right above the prompt box opens a menu pane, docked on the right, with a Prompt Upgrade on/off switch and one-press shortcuts to `/better` and `/work-report`. USER and PROJECT sections list your own skills and commands, each of which you can turn off. A remote control, so every row runs a command that already exists; it shows the model and effort but never changes them. Shows rows when `prompt-upgrade` or `work-report` is installed, or you have commands of your own. Idea from [tristenobrien.ai](https://tristenobrien.ai/); how to use it: [arsenal/README.md](./arsenal/README.md). Why: [arsenal/DESIGN.md](./arsenal/DESIGN.md). |
| [`waypoints`](./waypoints) | A route for `/goal` and any multi-step work, built from Claude's own task plan: the plan drawn as nodes and legs above the prompt, an ETA at the goal's own pace, a pane that opens by itself with the whole task trail, and every chat's goal in `/waypoints`. Follows Agent-Pulse's palette and animation. The mod itself asks Claude to plan, so nothing goes in the global `CLAUDE.md`. Fork of Nate Herk's goal-meter; what changed: [waypoints/README.md](./waypoints/README.md). |

## Install (each computer)

```
claude plugin marketplace add afterever/claude-mods
claude plugin install ctx@afterever-mods
claude plugin install subagent-progress@afterever-mods
claude plugin install prompt-upgrade@afterever-mods
claude plugin install work-report@afterever-mods
claude plugin install agent-pulse@afterever-mods
claude plugin install arsenal@afterever-mods
claude plugin install waypoints@afterever-mods
```

That installs the seven mods in this repo. The whole setup, with the third-party mods and the skins patch and skin, is in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

Pick up new versions with `claude plugin marketplace update afterever-mods` and then `claude plugin update ctx@afterever-mods` (restart Claude Code to apply).

## Use ctx

`/ctx` opens the pane and the 📊 button above the prompt toggles it. The commands, the keys inside the pane, and what to do when the pane sits above the prompt instead of docking on the right (it needs the fullscreen layout) are in [ctx/README.md](./ctx/README.md).

## Develop

From the root of this repo, edit a mod in place and load it from disk, which hot-reloads on save:

```
claude --plugin-dir .\ctx
```

Check a mod before committing:

```
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin test .\ctx
```

Claude Code writes `<mod>/.claude-plugin/types/` and `<mod>/tsconfig.json` each time it loads a mod. They are regenerated and git-ignored.

Bump `version` in the mod's `plugin.json` when you change it, or installed copies will not pick the change up.
